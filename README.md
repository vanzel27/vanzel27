# Hi, there! 👋

My name is Vanzel D'silva and I’m a passionate Computer Science graduate student at Clark University, with previous industry experience as a QA Tester at Montran and a Software Engineer at Gbytes. I specialize in frontend development using **Ruby on Rails** and **JavaScript Hotwire**, and I enjoy creating sleek, high-performing applications.

I’m deeply interested in crafting meaningful user experiences, and outside of work, you’ll often find me watching anime, playing piano, or brushing up on my Japanese!

I’m currently sharpening my skills in full stack development and data visualization. Let’s connect and build something awesome!
